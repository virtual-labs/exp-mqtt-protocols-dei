      "question": "What is the main advantage of using MQTT protocol for IoT data transmission?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It requires high bandwidth",
        "b": "It is lightweight and efficient in low-bandwidth environments",
        "c": "It uses a large number of data packets",
        "d": "It is designed for large-scale file transfers"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "MQTT is designed for low-bandwidth environments, not high bandwidth.",
        "b": "MQTT is lightweight and ideal for low-bandwidth, high-latency, or unreliable networks.",
        "c": "MQTT minimizes the number of data packets to optimize efficiency.",
        "d": "MQTT is not used for large-scale file transfers, but rather for real-time data messages."
