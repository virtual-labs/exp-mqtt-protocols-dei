# Young's Double Slit Experiment - Interactive Simulation

An interactive physics simulation of Young's Double Slit Experiment with real-time wave visualization and precise physics calculations. This application allows users to explore wave interference through hands-on experimentation.

## Features

- Interactive visualization of wave propagation and interference patterns
- Real-time physics calculations with adjustable parameters:
  - Wavelength (380-700 nm)
  - Slit Separation (0.1-5.0 mm)
  - Screen Distance (10-100 cm)
- Educational content explaining the physics principles
- Drag-and-drop interface for adjusting slit positions and screen distance
- Precise measurements and calculations of fringe width
- Calculated wavelength and percentage error display
