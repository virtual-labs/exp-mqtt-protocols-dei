In this experiment, live sensor data is transmitted to an IoT platform using the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol, which is lightweight and ideal for low-bandwidth, high-latency environments. The ESP8266 or ESP32 microcontrollers act as clients that collect data from sensors and send it to an IoT platform (such as ThingSpeak, AWS, or Microsoft Azure) using MQTT. The IoT platform receives and processes the data, allowing for real-time monitoring and analysis of sensor values.
